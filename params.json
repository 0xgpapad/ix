{"name":"Ix","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\nCommodity operating systems fail in maintaining the high throughput and low (tail) latency when applications require millions of operations per second and just hundreds of microseconds for slowest requests. However, these requirements are not rare in today's datacenters (e.g. for key-value stores) where every individual slack off in latency effects multiple requests due to distributed fan-out computational model. Overprovisioning of resources is often the big hammer of taming the latency curve which leads to low utilization of datacenters.\r\n\r\nIX is a specialized dataplane library operating system that solves the 4-way trade-off between high throughput, low latency, strong protection and energy efficiency. IX separates the control plane from the dataplane using hardware virtualization, therefore maintaining the strong protection offered by existing kernels. The control plane implements resource allocation policies while the dataplane provides high networking I/O performance.\r\n\r\nThe network processing is optimized for both throughput and latency of event-driven latency critical applications by processing to completion bounded batches of packets, and by minimizing coherence traffic and multi-core synchronization. The control plane dynamically manages the resources (cores and frequency) driven by different policies (e.g. energy proportionality).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAt EPFL [DCSL](http://dcsl.epfl.ch/dcsl): Edouard Bugnion (@edbugnion), George Prekas (@prekageo), Mia Primorac (@MihaelaMia) and Bernard Gutermann (@bernardgut).
